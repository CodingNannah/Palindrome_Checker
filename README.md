# First 100 Days of Coding (started 1 Feb 2025) Project
From Tech with Tim Tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ml4x0rO1PQ at 30:22

## Purpose
1. Practice JS with a simple palindrome checker
2. Palindrome - spelled the same forward as backward

## What I changed + helpful references
1. Project did not call for CSS; added background and button colors
2. Alerts are NOT best practices: Added an html div for the message instead
3. Added js for success and error
4. Added colors to css to indicate success and error

## Future project expansion ideas
1. Create an awesome CSS background 
2. Add effects for hovering, clicking, and clicked button
3. Connect to an existing database and API
4. Erase messages and colors (back to neutral) upon a new input -- getting bogged down after a very few inputs requiring ctrl + shift + r to reset
